# FE21-CR5-MichaelR

The following criteria were graded:
- Create a GitHub Repository named: FE21-CR5-YourName. Push the files into it and send the link through the learning management system (lms). Add a collaborator and assure your repository is set to private. See an example of a GitHub link below:
https://github.com/JohnDoe/repositoryname.git
- create the class Locations based on the specifications.
- create at least 2 Locations objects by invoking a constructor call and save them in an array (class constructors usage is mandatory, do NOT use JSON and parsing).
- add a display() function to the Locations class that can display the Locations’ object as an HTML string. Use Bootstrap to solve design and responsiveness issues in an easy manner.
- use looping functionality to display the object saved in the array on the screen.
- create the classes Restaurant and Event with their respective properties. Invoke constructors, and save the resulting objects in an array(either in a general array containing all objects or in separate arrays containing specific class objects). Make sure that ALL info is displayed considering they are objects with different properties. 
- create a display() function for the classes Restaurant and Event respectively. display() is capable of displaying relevant information of its class as HTML. Again, use Bootstrap or CSS to solve design and responsiveness.
- Assure that the responsiveness of the page is as follows: for small screens, you see the teaser of one object (without the image) in a row. On medium screens, you see two teasers in a row (with image). On large screens, you see four objects in a row (with image).


**Bonus Points:**
- You have decided to add an additional date/time for every location that you visited. You add that information “Created: 24.03.2022 12:45” to respective teaser displays.
- You want to use the newly added entry to add two additional pages to your system index-asc.html  and index-desc.html  Those pages are sorting the array of locations (places, events, restaurant) ascending/descending based on the “Created” date/time property. (If you feel capable of rendering the ascending and descending in one HTML page instead of creating extra index-asc.html/index-desc.html pages, then you are welcome to keep it on one page.)
